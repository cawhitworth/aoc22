# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com)

Am:

* Doing it in Rust, for the learnings.
* Trying to make sure it's tested and handles at least some errors, even if the input is guaranteed to be well-formed.
* Trying to make sure clippy is happy.
* Trying to not write C/Python/C++ in Rust

Am not:

* Not trying for the shortest/cleverest solution.
* Not claiming it's the most idiomatic.
* Going to spend hours banging my head against the borrow checker if `derive`ing `Copy` for a 4-byte type lets me get on with my day.
